# The-Future-of-Hydrogen
Energy Systems Analysis Project
If societies want to abide by international treaties to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases (such as the Paris Agreement), clean fuel can only mean hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. According to this study, hydrogen has more potential in some sectors than others, which are in order of priority: road transport, industrial applications and domestic heating. The future of hydrogen can always be said to depend on the cost of producing, transporting and storing it. At present, hydrogen as an energy carrier is not able to compete with other energy carriers due to its economic viability, unless in the future using newer technologies will reduce the costs of production, transmission and storage or by implementing policies Some in reducing emissions and greenhouse gases have made communities more interested in using hydrogen.
